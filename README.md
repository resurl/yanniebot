yanniebot is a personal server Discord bot that was designed to replicate the commands of other popular bots and aggregate them into one interface.

(by the end of the project lol) This Discord bot is able to:
* play music
* talk in general chat
* send images
* host text channel games
* reads robert's tweets

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* You have installed the latest version of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
* You have a [Discord API key](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (placed as KEY='your-key' in /.env in the root directory)

Once those are done, run
`pip install -U discord.py`
`pip install -U youtube_dl`
in the python interpreter to ensure you have the proper modules
